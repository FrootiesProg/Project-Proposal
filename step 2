1. Tech Stack:

Front-end Framework: React
Chat Integration: Chat by Stream SDK
Real-time Translation: (Possible third-party service, e.g., browser API or other client-side translation services)
Front-end Hosting/Deployment: Vercel or Netlify

2. Front-end UI Design:
The UI will be minimalistic and intuitive, focusing on user experience. The design will incorporate:

A landing page with user registration/login.
A main dashboard showcasing posts 
Message Inbox 
Profile
Communities

A settings/preferences page for users to select their language.

3. Type of Web App:
A community-based chat application that facilitates real-time communication among users from different linguistic backgrounds by providing instant message translations.

4. Project Goal:
To break linguistic barriers in online communities by offering real-time chat translations, thus fostering diverse and inclusive conversations.

5. Target Users:
International users from diverse linguistic backgrounds.
Online community enthusiasts looking for global interactions.
Learners wanting to communicate in their target language.

6. Data Usage and Collection:
User Data: Usernames, chat history (locally), and language preferences.
Chat Data: Real-time messages, timestamps, and sender IDs.
Translation Data: Original messages and their translated counterparts.
While the primary API focus is on "Chat by Stream," a secondary API might be necessary for real-time translations, aiming for data containing message strings and their translated outputs.

7. Approach to Project Creation:
API Issues: Potential rate limits with the chat or translation API, delayed response times, or discrepancies in translation quality.
Sensitive Information: User chat data might be considered sensitive, and while it's stored locally, ensuring it's encrypted or secure would be a focus.
Functionality: User registration/login, joining/creating chat rooms, sending/receiving real-time messages, and opting for translations.
User Flow:
Landing page -> Register/Login.
Main dashboard with chat rooms -> Join/Create a room.

Chat interface -> Send/Receive messages.
Settings -> Change language preference.
Beyond CRUD: While the basic functionality revolves around CRUD operations, the real-time translation feature adds complexity. The app also involves WebSocket operations for real-time chat.
Stretch Goals: Voice message translations, emoji reactions to messages, a feature to tag/mention users, and possibly, a machine learning-based recommendation system for chat rooms based on user preferences.
