Tech Stack: For the final project, I will use React as the primary framework for building the front-end. 

Front-end UI Design: The front-end UI will be designed with a clean and intuitive user interface, featuring search filters for pet attributes such as species, breed, age, gender, and location. Additionally, there will be detailed pet profiles displaying images, descriptions, and contact information for adoption.

Website/App Type: I aim to build a web application that facilitates pet adoption by integrating the Petfinder API. Users will be able to search for adoptable pets based on various criteria and view detailed information about each pet.

Project Goal: The project's primary goal is to connect prospective pet owners with adoptable animals efficiently and effectively, streamlining the pet adoption process and increasing adoption rates.

User Demographic: The target demographic for our app includes individuals and families interested in adopting pets from shelters and rescue organizations. This demographic typically consists of animal lovers of all ages and backgrounds.

Data Plan: I plan to use the Petfinder API to access a wide range of data on adoptable pets, including species, breeds, ages, genders, locations, descriptions, and images. The API will provide real-time data on pets available for adoption from various shelters and rescue groups.

Approach:

Potential API Issues: I may encounter rate-limiting or authentication issues with the Petfinder API, which I will address by implementing appropriate error handling and authentication mechanisms.
Sensitive Information: I need to ensure the security of user data, such as login credentials and personal information, by implementing encryption and secure authentication protocols.
Functionality: The app will include features such as user authentication, search functionality with filters, detailed pet profiles, favoriting pets, and contacting shelters/rescue groups.
User Flow: Users will start by searching for pets based on their preferences, view detailed pet profiles, and then proceed to contact shelters/rescue groups for adoption inquiries.
Unique Features: Beyond a CRUD app, my project will differentiate itself by offering real-time access to a comprehensive database of adoptable pets, personalized search filters, and seamless communication with shelters/rescue groups. Stretch goals include implementing a matching algorithm based on user preferences and pet attributes.
By integrating the Petfinder API into my web application, I aim to create a user-friendly platform that facilitates pet adoption and contributes to the well-being of animals in need.
